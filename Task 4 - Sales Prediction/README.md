# Task 4: Sales Prediction 📈

### 💼 Internship - CodSoft (July Batch B41)
This project focuses on predicting product sales using advertising budgets across various media: TV, Radio, and Newspaper. The model learns relationships from past data and predicts future sales values.

---

### 📊 Dataset Used
**File**: advertising.csv  
**Features**:
- `TV`: Budget spent on TV advertising  
- `Radio`: Budget spent on radio advertising  
- `Newspaper`: Budget spent on newspaper advertising  
- `Sales`: Units sold (target variable)

---

### ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

### 🔍 What’s inside?
- Data visualization using `pairplot`, heatmap
- Linear Regression model training
- Prediction and performance metrics
- Plot: Actual vs Predicted Sales

---

### 🧪 How to Run
1. Open `sales_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
2. Make sure the dataset file `advertising.csv` is in the same directory
3. Run all the cells to:
   - Load and explore data
   - Train a model
   - Visualize performance
