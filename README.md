# Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

## Description
This project is focused on predicting passenger survival during the Titanic disaster using supervised machine learning techniques. It uses real-world data including attributes like age, gender, passenger class, and fare.

## Dataset
- File: `Titanic-Dataset.csv`
- Source: Provided as part of the internship task

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Open `titanic_model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Run each cell in sequence to load data, preprocess, train a model, and evaluate it.

## Output
- Model Accuracy on test data
- Confusion Matrix
- Feature insights and visualizations
