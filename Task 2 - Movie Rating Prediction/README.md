# Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction ðŸŽ¬ðŸ“Š

## Description
This project focuses on predicting IMDb ratings for Indian movies using machine learning. It involves feature extraction from movie metadata (like genre, votes, runtime, etc.), preprocessing, training a regression model, and evaluating its accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `IMDb Movies India.csv`, containing details like:
- Title
- Genre
- Release year
- Runtime
- Votes
- IMDb Rating

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Open `movie_rating_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Run all cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and view performance.

## Output
- ðŸ“ˆ Regression model trained
- ðŸ“Š Evaluation metrics (RÂ² Score, MAE, MSE)
- ðŸ“‰ Visualizations: distribution, correlation heatmap, prediction comparison
